# A* Algorithm Path Enhancement Comparative Study


# Overview

Welcome to the repository for our groundbreaking research project, which recently secured the 5th position at the 10th Undergraduate Engineering Mathematics Research Forum hosted by TCCD - Career Center at the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University.

Our project focuses on the comparative study of two techniques designed to enhance A* algorithm paths: Voronoi fields and the innovative Sandwich approach.

# Implementation Details
## A* Algorithm
you can check our A* implementation that we use in the AStar folder.
## Voronoi potential fields
Our implementation of Voronoi fields enhances the A* algorithm by leveraging the geometric properties of Voronoi diagrams to guide the pathfinding process. You can check the code in the VoronoiAStar folder.

## Sandwich approach
The Sandwich approach introduces a novel technique based on PDEs to enhance the A* algorithm's pathfinding capabilities. You can check our trial implementations in the SandwichAStar folder.
